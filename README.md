# Dancer2 Example Application

This is an example web application written using Perl's [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2) framework.

I have written it using [GitHub Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace).

I started with the standard Dancer2 app generated using `dancer2 gen -a Example`. Every step
since then has worked like this:

* I wrote [an issue describing the next step](https://github.com/davorg/dancer-example/issues)
* I then opened Copilot Workspace and asked it to implement the required changes
* I applied the [pull request](https://github.com/davorg/dancer-example/pulls) that Copilot Workspace generated

You can read through the [closed issues](https://github.com/davorg/dancer-example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
and the [merged pull requests](https://github.com/davorg/dancer-example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see how it went.

It's been interesting. The results have been mixed. But generally better than I expected.
